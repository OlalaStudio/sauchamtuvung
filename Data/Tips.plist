		<string>Reading Questions Strategy: 3 Rules You Must Known</string>
		<key>Des</key>
		<string>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rules for Reading Comprehension Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Know the rules that govern most reading comprehension questions will help you answer them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 1: No More, No Less&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text says exactly what it says&amp;mdash;nothing more. For example, if the text says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Former presidents make good money giving speeches at universities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then an answer choice that says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ex-politicians can support themselves as speakers because their fame makes them popular with young audiences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is probably a wrong answer, because it adds more information that originally appeared in the text. It may actually be true that ex-politicians are popular with younger audiences, but that isn&amp;#39;t what the text says. The text just says that former presidents (not all ex-politicians) make good money giving speeches at universities (not necessarily to young audiences). The text also doesn&amp;#39;t say why this is true, but the wrong answer&amp;nbsp; includes an extra reason (popularity with young audiences).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, you can&amp;#39;t read anything at all into the questions or the text. Read the text like a contract, not like a novel. Every word counts, and ONLY the words count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 2: Objectivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although a question might seem like it asks you to speculate about an author&amp;#39;s intent, the right answer is actually totally objective. The test isn&amp;#39;t really asking yo what the purpose of a phrase &amp;quot;might&amp;quot; be, even if the test uses that word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get tricked into thinking that answering a question requires some interpretation on your part. It doesn&amp;#39;t. The less you try to interpret what the text says, the more questions you&amp;#39;ll answer correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test is designed so that any interpretation at all will quickly become misinterpretation, and you&amp;#39;ll get questions wrong, you&amp;#39;ll lose points and your score will go down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 3: One Right Answer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one, and only one, correct answer per question. I can&amp;#39;t tell you know many times I&amp;#39;ve heard students complain that more questions have more than one good answer. It isn&amp;#39;t true. Every question has one good answer and ONLY one good answer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must approach the test with the idea that each question has one right answer and that you can find this answer by using above rules.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

		<string>TOEIC LISTENING TIPS PART 1</string>
		<key>Des</key>
		<string>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The following TOEIC listening tips will help you beware of test traps, and direct you to the right answer. Remember, it is possible to get a score of 100% in the listening section. Many students have done so before you, and you can too, so keep your eyes and ears open and your motivation high.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHOTOGRAPHS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first part of the TOEIC listening section, you will see photographs and then be asked to select a sentence which best describes the pictures. The key to doing well is to read each of the four options carefully. The three incorrect answers may have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;words that sounds similar but are in fact different&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;the right words used inaccurately&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;the right words used in a confusing manner&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;answers that are only partially true&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;words that refer to a context other than the one shown in the picture&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;words related to, but not in the picture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to approach these questions is to scan the picture completely and identify what&amp;#39;s happening, just like a journalist or a spy. Ask yourself: who, what, where, why? Listen for any words that are stressed, as they may hold a clue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QUESTION - RESPONSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second part of the TOEIC listening section, you will be asked a question about almost anything and you need to choose a suitable answer. The trick here is to watch out for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;words that sound similar but have different meanings&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;wh- questions - who what, when, where, why, what - that need logical answers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;questions with question tags&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;yes / no questions which may have no direct yes / no answers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do well, keep the question clearly in mind as you scan the possible answers. Choose the one that makes the greatest sense. If in doubt, guess. You won&amp;#39;t lose points.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

		<string>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHORT CONVERSATIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the third part, you will hear a short dialogue and then be asked a question about what you have heard. You need to use your short-term memory well. The best strategies are to beware of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;similar-sounding words&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;inaccurate words&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;confused word order&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;words that change the meaning&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;negative words (hardly, not, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;words associated with time (always, never, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will help if you can read the question, and possibly even the answers, before you hear the dialogue. Check all the options and don&amp;#39;t choose too quickly. Try and picture the speakers and where they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHORT TALK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the fourth part of the listening section, you will hear a monologue and then be asked a question about it. The same precautions should be exercised as in the earlier sections, but you will need to concentrate more carefully to remember the details. Pay close attention to the context. Try to read the questions beforehand if you have time, and listen to the entire talk before choosing an answer. Use your time wisely or else guess at an answer. Don&amp;#39;t get left behind or lose important information related to the next question.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

		<string>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOEIC Reading Tips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INCOMPLETE SENTENCES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do well in this part, you should know the various parts of speech and how they are used to form a grammatically correct sentence. In particular, you must be careful of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Two-part phrasal verbs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Incorrect use of prepositions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Incorrectly placed adjectives&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Incorrect word forms&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Incorrect grammatical tense&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Incorrect transition word such as however, furthermore, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Incorrect conjunctions such as and, but, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many choices may seem close until you try them out, so to save time, try to identify the grammatical function of the word in the blank.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

		<string>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEXT COMPLETION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategies used here are similar, in essence, to those used for Incomplete Sentences above. The difference is that because the blanks you must fill in are part of longer pieces of writing, such as letters, you need to keep not only the grammatical aspect in mind but also the context and tone of the entire piece of writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READING COMPREHENSION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in all reading comprehension exercises, a variety of skills are required to deduce the right answer. These include skimming, scanning, paraphrasing, and understanding vocabulary in context. You must be able to identify synonyms and implied information. A clue is that the order of the questions follows the order to the information in the reading passage. This should save time when scanning for specific details. Make sure the answer you choose answers the question, as many of the answer choices may simply repeat information in the reading passage. Lastly, you might prefer reading the questions before skimming the passage, to give you a better idea of what&amp;#39;s to come. Complete many practice TOEIC reading exercises to familiarize yourself with common reading passage topics.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

		<string>5 Great Tips to Master the TOEIC Listening</string>
		<key>Des</key>
		<string>&lt;p&gt;The TOEIC listening exam is not just listening for comprehension but it also requires the listener to understand vocabulary, discriminate between certain sounds, understand grammatical structures and also understand intonation and stress &amp;ndash; all of which needs to be done while understanding the much wider socio-cultural context of the dialogue. In saying all of this, it is not as easy as it seems to pass the TOEIC listening with top marks. The TOEIC exam is renowned for inserting many trick questions and traps which can throw even the most confident student off course and as the listening dialogue is only heard one time students must be able to remain focused and on the ball. Here are just a few helpful strategies that you can adopt and utilize within the ESL/EFL classroom to ensure success in the TOEIC listening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Bombard Them with Test Papers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s recommended to really give your students constant practice with past papers under test conditions. There are many different activities that you can do in the classroom with TOEIC but the best thing to do is to have them do past papers (all parts included) in order for them to get used to the quick transitions, fast pace and the types of traps that they may come across. At first guide them gently, stop the recording after each question and ask them to answer it and discuss why or why not they are correct giving them a clear insight to what they are doing right and wrong. Gradually build your way up to playing more questions in succession. The gradual progress towards answering more questions will build confidence and it will also help you as a teacher which areas need focusing on more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Mastering the True or False Questions in Part One&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For part one of the TOEIC listening exam students are required to look at a series of photographs that depict real life situations e.g. a supermarket worker moving boxes and the student will hear four statements. Upon hearing the statements the students will be required to check the box which is true related to the picture that they see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start with, have your students focus on one picture and play each statement pausing after each one. Ask your students to raise their hands to which statement they believe is true in relation to the photograph. This is a great way of introducing part one as it builds confidence and is not too taxing. Additionally, it will help you as a teacher to identify from the outset which particular students have the most difficulties with this section of the TOEIC listening paper. This is a great exercise to use in large classes where it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to initially understand each individual student&amp;rsquo;s needs and level. This activity acts as a type of assessment if executed properly and from here you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to determine which students need extra help and work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also possible to add a little bit more variation to the above exercise in the beginning to change it up slightly. Play all of the statements related to the picture according to what the students will hear in the real TOEIC test and after all four statements have been played, stop the CD and read the options A-B-C-D out loud with a short pause after each letter. Again students are required to show their hands to indicate which answer they believe to be true. The variation still allows the teacher to distinguish the weaker learners, however, this time it&amp;rsquo;s slightly more authentic in terms of test practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Practicing Prediction in Part 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section of the test is made up of 31 different questions and students will hear a short statement such as: hand me over that stapler, will you? Upon hearing it, the students will then hear a series of three questions e.g. A. Here you are. B. It&amp;rsquo;s in the other hand. C. It&amp;rsquo;s over there in the drawer. The students are then required to choose which the most appropriate response in accordance to the initial statement is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to again press play on the CD and allow them to hear the first statement. Immediately after they&amp;rsquo;ve heard it, pause the recording and ask the students to brainstorm a few appropriate responses to the statement. This process will help activate their knowledge and prepare them for the three different responses. After they&amp;rsquo;ve discussed their ideas a bit, you can then continue to play the rest of the recording with the corresponding responses so the class and in turn they will able to identify the correct response easier. Because the TOEIC listening is only heard once and it can be rather fast in some places learning how to activate pre-existing knowledge and utilizing prediction skills will help them to imagine the correct response prior to hearing the different options thus making it easier to answer the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Help Students to Understand What&amp;rsquo;s Happening in a Conversation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part three is slightly longer than the previous two sections and requires the students to listen to ten different everyday conversations and then answer multiple choice based questions based on the scenario. This section needs more work and focus as it requires more concentration and it&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon for students to be feeling slightly tired by this point of the exam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you even play the first conversation to your students, write three questions (without the answer options) on the whiteboard. Explain to your students that you want them to listen to the following dialogue and they need to try and find the correct answer for each particular question. After the students have heard the conversation and write their own answers down, have them compare their answers together. After comparing, give them the four different answer options and allow them to select which is the correct one based on what they have heard and the answer they&amp;rsquo;ve already written down. This is particularly helpful as this is the area where many traps lie, especially when it comes to numbers and dates as the recording could actually mention more than one of the figures. The whole purpose of this particular exercise it to facilitate your students&amp;rsquo; focus &amp;ndash; it helps them to pay more attention to specific details without being distracted by curve balls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Help Your Students to Understand What&amp;rsquo;s Going on in Short Talks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part four requires the exam takers to listen to three short talks relating to different scenarios. There are three questions per talk and the student is required to answer the best answer that fits the situation best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before playing these short talks to your students, ask them to underline all of the key words in all three questions and additionally in the answer choices &amp;ndash; this may take some guidance at the beginning to ensure they just highlight the necessary words. After they get the hang of identifying the key words have them do it in a period of 7 seconds to help them to keep at the same pace of the recording. Immediately after your time limit has passed, play the recording without exceptions as this will force students to work quickly and remain focused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part four is the trickiest section to do well in when it comes to the TOEIC listening and it&amp;rsquo;s incredibly easy for the students to fall behind due to the speed of the recording and lack of breaks between each question. This particular exercise will encourage students to work quickly skimming through the questions and the answer options as quickly as possible. When they improve their previewing speed, they&amp;rsquo;ll have more of a chance of keeping up with the speed of the recording which is the main thing that lets the exam takers down in this part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled into thinking that the TOEIC listening section is easy because it just consists of answering multiple-choice questions - it&amp;rsquo;s not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It needs careful practice and good strategy and speed and therefore it&amp;rsquo;s imperative for the tutor to spend as much time as possible going through different methods to ensure the students will achieve high marks.&lt;/p&gt;

		<string>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is the TOEIC?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TOEIC or Test of English for International Communication, is a standardized, paper-and-pencil test given to non-native English speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Uses TOEIC Results?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporations and government agencies recruiting new hires&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Educational institutions establishing placement in English classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is on the TOEIC?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional TOEIC only tests two skills: Listening and Reading. However, ETS, the makers of the TOEIC, have added a TOEIC Speaking and Writing Test to bolster the useful information a corporation may need to assess the competency of a job applicant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Long is the TOEIC?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 2 &amp;frac12; hours&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;45 minutes for TOEIC Listening&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;70 minutes for TOEIC Reading&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;30 minutes to complete a biographical profile&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How Do You Register for the TOEIC?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOEIC Listening&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many test-takers believe that the Listening portion of the TOEIC is the most difficult part of the test, even though it only runs approximately 45 minutes. Why? Both the questions (100 of them) and possible responses for Parts 1 and 2 are only spoken not printed. Parts 3 and 4 contain questions that are both printed and spoken, so it&amp;rsquo;s a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOEIC Reading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharpen up those vocabulary, grammar, parts of speech and comprehension skills, because the Reading Comprehension section is a doozy. ETS has redesigned sections of the TOEIC, so if you&amp;rsquo;ve looked at prep material before 2008, you should know there have been a few changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll sit for 70 minutes, and answer a total of 100 questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Is the TOEIC Scored?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the Reading section and the Listening section can earn you between 5 and 495 points on a scaled score range, so your total score can be anywhere from a 10 - 990. You&amp;#39;ll receive a raw score from your correct answers, and that raw score will be converted to the scaled score.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

		<string>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preview involves skimming over a reading passage to get a general idea of its content and to help focus the reader&amp;#39;s mind on the topic. It is a very valuable tool in faster reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To preview, look at the title and subtitles, then read quickly over the first and last paragraphs and skim through the rest of the passage to get an idea of what the passage will be about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are comprehension questions, read them after the preview to help focus the mind on specific ideas to look for. Then read the passage, looking for answers to the questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are no comprehension questions, try turning the title and subtitles into questions to help you look for meaning in your reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read through the passage carefully, but not too slowly. Keep in mind the questions you have formed so that you will be able to concentrate and stay focused on the reading material. In reading, try to keep a steady pace and avoid going back over words or phrases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading, skim over the passage again to remember main ideas and subpoints. Think of the answers to the questions or form an outline of the passage in your mind as you review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vocabulary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is best to check the meanings of words in the passage, either before or after the reading, not during, as this will slow down your reading pace. Try to guess the what the words mean from the context (surrounding words) and only check the dictionary as a last resort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is sometimes useful to check your progress by keeping track of reading time, rate (words per minute) and comprehension (a percentage of correct answers to questions). There are several texts which enable you to do this through exercises. One of the best is a series entitled Timed Readings.&lt;/p&gt;</string>
